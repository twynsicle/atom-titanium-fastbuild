The toolbar provides a UI to commonly used commands when developing a Titanium application. Further information on each function is provided in the sections below.

##### 1. Build select and run

Select to run on simulator or device, package for ad-hoc or App Store distribution or a custom build option.

##### 2. Platform select

Select available platforms to build for.

##### 3. Target select

Select simulator/emulator or local device. When attaching a device, select Refresh Targets option to add it to the target list.

##### 4. Code signing / Android KeyStore configuration 

When building for device (iOS) or distribution (iOS and Android) the option to configure code signing or keystore credentials is available.

##### 5. Info panel

Provides information about the active project.

##### 6. Generate component

Presents a dialog to generate a Titanium component: Controller, View, Style, Model, Widget or Alloy.jmk file.

##### 7. Console

Show or hide the console which outputs debug information during build and run.

#### Build

The build select button executes and provides selections of the build command. Depending on the target platform selected, the drop-down will display options for the `appc run` command:

* Run: Build and run the app on selected simulator/emulator or device
* Ad-Hoc: (iOS only) build and package the app for Ad-Hoc distribution using selected code signing
* Publish: Build and package the app for distribution through the App Store or Google Play using selected code signing or keystore credentials
* Custom: Execute `appc run -d <project_dir>` with custom arguments

#### Console

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2697821/33169526-ed531cf2-d03c-11e7-8d08-5657f691aca2.png" width="876px" alt="Build command select" />

The console displays debug logging during the build and run. The log level is passed to the `appc run` comand so selecting the log level does not alter output from the currently executing command. There are options to automatically scroll the console to the latest message and to open it when a build is initiated. 

**By default the executing command is displayed in the console to aid debugging. This can be disabled in the package settings.**

#### iOS code signing

When building for a device and ad-hoc or App Store distribution, a certificate and provisioning profile must be selected. Click the code signing / keystore button (#4) to display the code signing options.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2697821/33169525-ed3f58a2-d03c-11e7-9b58-48b361328d69.png" width="479px" alt="iOS code signing" />

Certificates are populated according to the selected build option (developer / distribution). Available provisioning profiles are displayed but only those which match the selected certificate and app ID are enabled.

#### Android KeyStore

When building for distribution through Google Play, the app must be signed with a keystore. Click the code signing / keystore button (#4) to display the keystore options.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2697821/33169528-ed7b7922-d03c-11e7-9647-cc39256dc94a.png" width="1110px" alt="Android keystore" />

The path to the keystore can be entered manually or by using the file picker. Keystore path and alias are stored in package configuration.

### Autocompletion

Autocompletion support is provided to help speed up development by providing quick references to Titanium APIs and Alloy markup as well as references to modules, widgets and assets within your project.

#### Generation

On initial launch, autocomplete suggestions are generated for the current selected Titanium SDK. You can check and set this using the CLI:

```
$ appc ti sdk

...

Installed SDKs:
   7.0.0.GA [selected]  7.0.0.GA
```

```
$ appc ti sdk select
```

Autocomplete suggestions can be regenerated by selecting the 'Regenerate autocomplete suggestions' option from the package settings and relaunching Atom.

A UI for the `alloy generate` command is provided. The Generate File dialog is presented by clicking the + icon in the toolbar or using the command from the menu or palette. Select the type of file or component to generate and provide the required information. The generated file(s) are then opened.

### Open related files

* From Controller, open related View and/or Style

### Jump-to-definition

Jump-to-definition support is provided for quickly accessing the definiion or usage of Alloy markup and to easily generate new definitions. Images can be opened directly from their path.

#### Alloy

From Views, click through to style definitions for tags, classes and IDs, in related or global TSS. Click through to event definitions in the related controller.

#### Strings

Click on localised string references to jump to their definition. The option to generate undefined strings is provided.

#### Images

Click on an image path to open the image in a new tab. For iOS, where multiple scaled images exist with the same name the first is opened (e.g. @2x).

## Contributions

This package would not be possible without support from the Titanium community. Autocompletion, jump-to-definition and grammar support provided by [Jong Eun Lee](https://github.com/yomybaby) through the [Titanium Alloy package](https://github.com/yomybaby/atom-titanium).
